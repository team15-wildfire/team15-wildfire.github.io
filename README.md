What is the actual problem and how does BOWDS solve it?

Wildfires burn millions of acres of farmland and cause billions of dollars  in damage each year. They often begin through careless human activity or natural means such as thunderstorms. Our system is designed to notice and alert the owner of the system to either type, be it wildfires in remote or extreme areas where humans might not go, or wildfires started in places such as campgrounds. With easy to set up nodes, and has a long range communication network, all that is required is a host computer with wifi in range of the master node. The user will have constant access to the temperature, the concentration of CO gas and smoke particulates, and optionally, snapshot picture updates of the surroundings of the node.
